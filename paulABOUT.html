				<h1 style="color: red;"> MORE ABOUT PAUL </h1>
				<p style="color: white;"><b> MY NAME IS PAUL JAYZER COMILA, AND I'M A 20-YEAR-OLD FROM LA TRINIDAD, BENGUET. I GREW UP IN KAPANGAN, BENGUET, WITH FOUR BROTHERS AND ONE SISTER. CURRENTLY, I'M STUDYING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AT KINGS COLLEGE OF THE PHILIPPINES. DURING MY FREE TIME, I ENJOY PLAYING BASKETBALL, AND MY FAVORITE PLAYER AND INSPIRATION IS LEBRON JAMES. I ALSO ENJOY DRIVING AROUND AND EXPLORING NEW PLACES. MY ULTIMATE GOAL IN LIFE IS TO BE SUCCESSFUL, AND I BELIEVE THAT HARD WORK, DETERMINATION, AND A POSITIVE ATTITUDE ARE KEY INGREDIENTS TO ACHIEVING MY ASPIRATIONS. MY PERSONAL MOTTO IS "BELIEVE IN YOURSELF AND ALL THAT YOU ARE. KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING INSIDE YOU THAT IS GREATER THAN ANY OBSTACLE." THIS QUOTE BY CHRISTIAN D. LARSON REMINDS ME TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN MY ABILITIES AND TO NEVER GIVE UP ON MY DREAMS.</b></p>
